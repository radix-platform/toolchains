   patchelf-0.10.1-check-endianness.patch - Check ELF endianness before writing new runpath.

                                            This patch makes a change to the way the RUNPATH field
                                            is updated in the dynamic section. Currently, patchelf does
                                            not take into account the target architecture of the ELF file
                                            before doing this. Thus, the elf file ends up having an invalid
                                            tag for RUNPATH if the endianness differs. (0x1d000000 instead
                                            of 0x0000001d).

                                            The change proposed here updates the way these fields are written
                                            using the already defined endian-safe functions. Tested on both
                                            PowerPC and ARM targets with a x86_64 host.
