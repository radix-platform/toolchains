   glibc-2.23-vfork-alias.patch:
   ============================

   With recent binutils versions the GNU libc fails to build on at least
   MISP and SPARC, with this kind of error:

     ..../glibc-build/nptl/libpthread.so:(*IND*+0x0): multiple definition of `vfork@GLIBC_2.0'
     ..../glibc-build/nptl/libpthread.so::(.text+0xee50): first defined here

   It appears that on these architectures pt-vfork.S includes vfork.S
   (through the alpha version of pt-vfork.S) and that the __vfork aliases
   are not conditionalized on IS_IN (libc) like on other architectures.
   Therefore the aliases are also wrongly included in libpthread.so.

   Fix this by properly conditionalizing the aliases like on other
   architectures.
